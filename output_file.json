One of the people next to the bathroom banged on the wall while my partner was in the shower because the water was hitting the wall...you should hope you don't get that room. There is no light in the shower, so you feel like you are entering a dungeon. I wouldn't say the location is great either. The good thing is that there is a cab stand right outside the door...literally. Unfortunately, it's VERY loud outside, so we had to put white noise on to drown out the screaming people (and we were on the 5th floor.) The bed was worn down and the wall was dirty.

True, the rooms are basic, but they're cleaned daily and the hotel provides soap, shampoo, etc., as needed, plus clean towels. 2) Breakfast is included in the price. As some have noted, it can be \"monotonous,\" but the staff try to mix it up, making eggs in various styles - omlettes, fried, scrambled, and so forth. For a little more variety, however, you can always try the Park Cafe at the south entrance to Finsbury Park, a short walk away, which offers an excellent full-on English breakfast for 4 pounds and friendly service. There's another cafe next to Manor House station that also offers breakfast if you're hankering for ham and sausage. 3) Neighborhood: Finsbury Park isn't a happening night-spot, full of pubs and clubs, but you can jump on the Victoria Line at Finsbury Park and be in Islington in less than 10 minutes, with no end of tapas bars, wine bars, pubs, and restaurants to choose from on Upper Street. You can also be downtown, in the tourist district around Covent Garden and Soho, in about 20 minutes via the Picadilly Line from Manor House, which is literally right outside the front door of Kent Hall and a one-minute (if that) walk to the right. Coming home late? No worries: there's a 24-hour shop open on the corner, and several late-night kebab places that will cure the munchies late into the night. 4) Convenience: If you're working at the British Library as a visiting researcher, you can leave the hotel at 9 AM and be at the Library, via Kings Cross station, with time enough to grab a quick cup of tea or coffee before the doors open at 9:30 AM. Need laundry done? The hotel doesn't offer this service, but there's a laundry at the corner that will wash and dry a fairly large bag of clothes for 8-10 pounds, with next-day service. There's also a post office by Finsbury Park Station for changing travelers' cheques, mailing items, etc. 5) Helpfulness: The staff are helpful and accommodating and friendly - you won't always get this at more expensive hotels in central London. The staff there will be very professionally dressed and often completely unhelpful. At Kent Hall, there's a relaxed atmosphere and the sort of flexibilities you often won't find at more expensive hotels. 6) Secure: The hotel front desk is manned 24-hours and your room is very secure. Using good judgment is essentially here, as elsewhere, but unlike the situation at a big hotel, you'll probably know who the cleaning staff are at Kent Hall. From what I could tell, the management was very careful about who they hired. Some remarks on the neighborhood: Finsbury Park is a very ethnically-diverse locale, but certainly not dangerous. You're far more likely to have your pocket picked in Soho or Leicester Square. The ethnic mix of Finsbury Park - Turkish, Jamaican, Greek, Jewish, Pakistani and Indian, Polish, and now Spanish (and, of course, English) makes for an astonishing variety of cheap restaurants and a vibrant atmosphere.
